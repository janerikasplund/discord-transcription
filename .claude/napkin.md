## Corrections
| Date | Source | What Went Wrong | What To Do Instead |
|------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 2026-03-03 | self | Initially assumed `AbortError` during voice join meant the connection was explicitly destroyed by overlapping starts. | Confirm `@discordjs/voice` error semantics in source; `entersState(..., timeout)` aborts with `AbortError` on timeout. |

## User Preferences
- Keep responses concise and practical.

## Patterns That Work
- Use `rg` for fast repo-wide searches before patching.
- For auto voice-start reliability, gate per-guild starts with a pending set and destroy stale `getVoiceConnection(guildId)` objects after failed readiness waits.
- For npm release-date checks, parse `npm view <pkg> time --json` via Node and extract specific versions to avoid massive logs.

## Patterns That Don't Work
- None recorded yet.

## Domain Notes
- Project: `discord-transcription`.
- User wants Anthropic model references modernized from Sonnet 3.7-era naming to `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- Anthropic model is hardcoded in `src/transcriptManager.ts` at each `anthropic.messages.create` call; keep these in sync when changing models.
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk@0.38.0` in this repo lacks typed support for Claude 4.6 `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` and `effort`; model string `claude-sonnet-4-6` still compiles.
- 2026-02-19: User chose to keep current Anthropic integration as-is for now (no SDK upgrade yet). Revisit later to adopt Claude 4.6 `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` + `effort` once SDK support is upgraded.
- 2026-02-19: Deepgram streaming model remains `nova-3` for this bot; keep README/docs aligned with runtime model setting.
- 2026-02-19: Summary prompts now include canonical-name normalization (Jan, Walter, Marcelo, Danny, Trey) and username mapping (`smalter` -> Walter, `loopboi` -> Danny), plus a one-line `Easter Egg` ending.
- 2026-02-19: Self mistake: introduced duplicate `keyterm` field while editing `src/createListeningStream.ts`; fixed immediately by removing the duplicate key.
- 2026-02-19: User wants the summary ending `Easter Egg` to sound like a personal in-house assistant rooting for the team, with motivation grounded in the specific meeting content.
- 2026-02-19: Easter Egg line must be the final line of summary output and formatted as dialogue with robot emoji + quotes: `🤖 "<one sentence>"`.
- 2026-02-19: User prefers non-corny summary endings; switched final line format to `:happysacraman: "<one sentence>"` and toned voice down to understated, concrete operator-style language.
- 2026-02-19: Reverted ending style from operator-note to classical quote line. Final line should be `:happysacraman: "<quote>" — <author>`, chosen from approved philosopher/strategist pool and tangentially related to meeting content.
- 2026-02-19: User prefers no hardcoded quotes. Prompt now provides only preferred authors (Caesar, Seneca, Nietzsche, Aristotle, Aurelius, Sun Tzu, Drucker) and asks Claude to generate a quote-like line inspired by one selected author.
- 2026-02-19: Removed `:happysacraman:` from final quote line because it did not render correctly in Discord; format is now `"<quote>" — <author>`.
- 2026-02-19: Removed re-condensing/truncation flow for summaries. New behavior: ask Claude to target ~1400 chars and split across multiple Discord messages only at section boundaries when needed.
- 2026-02-19: For split summaries, user wants original single-summary visual style preserved: title/recording/`Summary:` only once in first message, with no repeated `Summary (continued)` noise in later messages.
- 2026-02-19: Quote author selection now happens in code via random choice, then prompt pins Claude to that exact author attribution to avoid repeated Sun Tzu outputs.
- 2026-03-03: In this codebase, `entersState(connection, VoiceConnectionStatus.Ready, 20e3)` throws `AbortError: The operation was aborted` on timeout, so logs need extra state/permission context to identify root cause.
- 2026-03-03: Auto-start now preflights `ViewChannel`/`Connect` and `channel.full` before voice join to turn silent 20s timeouts into immediate actionable errors.
- 2026-03-03: Registry check: project lockfile pins `@discordjs/voice@0.18.0` (published 2024-11-17) and `discord.js@14.18.0` (published 2025-02-10), so a last-week dependency update is unlikely unless deploy pipeline ignored lockfile.
